# Cartoon-Filter-with-OpenCV-and-Python
 This project implements a cartoon effect for images using OpenCV and Python. The input image is first smoothed, then edges are detected, and finally the cartoon effect is created by combining the smoothed colors and the detected edges.
# Cartoon Filter

This project applies a cartoon effect to images using OpenCV and Python.

## How to Use
1. Upload your image to the notebook.
2. Run the code to apply the cartoon filter.
3. The result will be displayed side by side with the original image.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Features
- Smooths colors using bilateral filter.
- Detects edges using Canny edge detector.
- Combines smoothed image and edges for cartoon effect.

## Example
- Input: Original image.
- Output: Cartoon-style image.
